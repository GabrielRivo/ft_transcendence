# ExternalSecret for Kibana
# Context: ft-transcendence DevOps Module
# Component: ELK Stack / External Secrets Operator
#
# This ExternalSecret fetches the encryption key for Kibana security
# and the password for the 'kibana_system' user (if we were using built-in users,
# but here we might reuse the elastic user or a dedicated one).
# For simplicity in this setup, we'll fetch the encryption key and reuse the elastic password
# (though best practice is a dedicated user, we'll start simple).
